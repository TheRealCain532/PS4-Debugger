# PS4-Debugger
This is an open source debugger for the Playstaiton 4 which utilizes the dbeug lib built by golden.
It still uses golden's debug payload as well and with his permission some of the code used in his debugger. I mainly wanted a debugger with a few more features in it ;) A lot of the credit goes to golen for the concept and core code. I just optimized it a bit and put my own spin to things. Happy Modding everybody!
This project may still have several bugs so please report them as you find them!
